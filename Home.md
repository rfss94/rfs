Ready to be in the middle? You better be!

Here you will find all the resources necessary to install, configure and use MITMf!

#**Some Assumptions**

I assume that whoever uses MITMf, has **at least** basic knowledge of the Linux OS, the command line, networking, and how to use/manage Python's [virtualenvs](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) and dependencies!

These docs are written with those assumptions in mind! 

If you don't know something, thankfully you live in an extraordinary era where information is at your fingertips! Google is your friend!
