#The configuration file
At the heart of MITMf lies it's configuration file [mitmf.conf](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/MITMf/tree/master/config), here you're able to tweak and change pretty much everything about the framework.

The config file is divided in sections, one for each plugin, with the exception of the [MITMf](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/MITMf/blob/master/config/mitmf.conf#L5) section at the very top.

This section is where you can configure how the framework connects with Metasploit and BeEF, you can also tweak the settings of DNS server.

**Note: Almost everything in the configuration file can be changed on the fly while MITMf is running**
