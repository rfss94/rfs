#**Frequently asked questions**
- **Is Windows supported?**
- Nope, it will never be supported

- **Is OSX supported?**
- Nope, Initially OSX support was on the table, unfortunately as of 0.9.8 MITMf needs a very Linux specific library for active packet filtering support

- **I can't install package X because of an error!**
- Try installing the package via ```pip``` or your distro's package manager. This is a problem with your system setup and not MITMf.
